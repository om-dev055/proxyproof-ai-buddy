# Architecture Notes

ProxyProof AI is designed with server-side validation as its core principle.

- Attendance is allowed only for active live sessions
- QR codes are tied to backend sessions, not client state
- Selfie verification ensures physical presence
- Google Gemini is used for explainable insights, not raw decision making

This design prevents common proxy attendance techniques while maintaining user privacy.
